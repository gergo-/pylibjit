Instructions for building and installing pylibjit. Sorry about the mess.

You will need a standard Linux-ish environment, with Python 3.x (tested with
3.2 and newer), a GCC-like C compiler, and usual development stuff.


1. Build and install libjit (the library that does actual code generation):

    cd libjit
    ./configure  # optionally: --prefix=/path/for/installation
    make
    make install  # possibly as root
    cd ..

If you specified your own --prefix above, you must tell your linker where to
find the dynamic library. For example (better solutions may exist):

    # Add this to startup scripts if needed.
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/pylibjit/install/lib/


2. Build and install libjit-python (the Python wrapper for libjit):

    cd libjit-python
    # if libjit was installed in a non-standard location, edit setup.py to
    # add that path to include_dirs and library_dirs
    python3 setup.py build
    # this will install a Python module named 'jit'
    python3 setup.py install  # use sudo, or use --user to install in home dir
    cd ..


3. Install pylibjit (the actual Python-to-libjit compiler):

    cd pylibjit
    python3 setup.py install # use sudo, or use --user to install in home dir
    cd ..


4. Test:

    cd examples
    # Now the following commands should run without error, and the second
    # one should be about 50 times faster than the first one (while printing
    # the same result).
    # The compiled version will dump various representations of the program
    # to the standard output while it works; this is intended.
    time python3 spectralnorm-interpret.py 1000
    time python3 spectralnorm-compile.py 1000
