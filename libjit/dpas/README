This directory contains an implementation of "Dynamic Pascal", or "dpas"
as we like to call it.  It is provided as an example of using "libjit"
in a real environment.  We also use it to write test programs that
exercise the JIT's capabilities.

More information on Dynamic Pascal can be found in libjit's Texinfo
documentation, "libjit/doc/libjit.texi".
