To generate HTML documentation, use the following command in the
"libjit/doc" directory:

	mkdir outdir
	./mkhtml.sh outdir

where "outdir" is the name of the directory to place the generated
HTML files in.

To generate PDF documentation, use the following command in the
"libjit/doc" directory:

	./mkpdf.sh

This will generate "libjit.pdf".  You will need to have PDFTeX installed
to do this.
